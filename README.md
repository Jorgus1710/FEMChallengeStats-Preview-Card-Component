## Overview

Another good challenge which made me re-aarange the order and flow of the design from mobile to desktop versions. Definetly some chunky code here, but this was great to fiddle around with various properties in order to get a better feel and intuition for what works and what doesnt.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

I start with mobile first as always. This challenge was interesting in that for the first time I had to re-arrange the layouts between mobile and desktop views. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned that images are inline by nature, and when applying an overlay color to them you are left with a small border at the bottom of the image. This is alleviated by changing the display of the image to display:block.


### Continued development

There are better practices to apply for sure. I still wonder if images should be linked inline in the html or better off in the css file, especially for instances liek this where two seperate images will be used for different views.
